REM  Realm Engine - build the Windows installer.
REM
REM  Run this on the Windows build machine (needs Visual Studio / MSBuild for
REM  the C++ DLL).
REM
REM  The repo lives in the WSL filesystem (\\wsl.localhost\...). cmd.exe cannot
REM  use a UNC path as the current directory, so this script uses `pushd`, which
REM  auto-maps the UNC path to a temporary drive letter for the build.
REM
REM  NOTE: building across the WSL 9p share from Windows works but is SLOW.
REM  If builds are painfully slow, clone the repo onto a real Windows drive
REM  (e.g. C:\dev\realm-engine) and run this from there instead.
REM
REM  Usage:
REM    build-installer.bat              installer + portable
REM    build-installer.bat portable     portable exe only (faster)
